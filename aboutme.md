>I love taking on challenges where we can leverage technology in novel ways to help others in need.

## About Me
I received my MSc in 2014 with a dissertation on mobile system wide assistive technology. 
Currently I am a fourth year PhD student at LASIGE at Faculdade de CiÃªncias da Universidade de Lisboa with the topic Facilitating Smartphone Use for Blind People through a Human-Powered Approach. 
My PhD research has been focused on mobile accessibility working closely with visually impaired people.

### Motivation

### Getting involved
I have also dedicated my time to variety of projects, such as: using robots to help visually impaired people; IoT care homes for people with 
motor-impairments; finding inaccessible people in natural disasters; creating new communication channels for people who are homeless.
