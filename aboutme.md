## About Me
I am a fourth year PhD Student at LASIGE, Universidade de Lisboa with the topic Facilitating Smartphone Use for Blind People through a Human-Powered Approach. My PhD advisors are Prof. [Tiago Guerreiro](https://tjvguerreiro.github.io/) from LASIGE at Universidade de Lisboa and Prof. [Kyle Montague](https://openlab.ncl.ac.uk/people/nkm120/) from Open Lab at Newcastle University. My PhD research has been mostly focused on mobile accessibility working closely with visually impaired people. In 2016 I spent three months abroad at Open Lab where new projects and collaborations spawned that are still ongoing. During my MSc in 2014 I was working with people with multiple impairements for my dissertation on mobile system wide assistive technology. 

## Getting involved
I have also dedicated my time to variety of projects, such as: using robots to help visually impaired people; IoT care homes for people with motor-impairments; finding inaccessible people in natural disasters; creating new communication channels for people who are homeless.
